Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a default sphere, hide it, and create a shrink filter from the sphere.
Double the sphere's theta resolution while halving the shrink filter's shrink factor.
Group the shrink filter and a wireframe of the sphere together, and save a screenshot of the result in 'shrink-sphere-screenshot.png', size 1920 x 1080 pixels with a white background.
