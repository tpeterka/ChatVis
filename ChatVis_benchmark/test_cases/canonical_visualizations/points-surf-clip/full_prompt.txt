I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Read in the file named 'can_points.ex2'.
Generate an 3d Delaunay triangulation of the dataset.
Clip the data with a y-z plane at x=0, keeping the -x half of the data and removing the +x half.
Render the image as a wireframe.
Save a screenshot of the result in the filename 'points-surf-clip-screenshot.png'.
The rendered view and saved screenshot should be 1920 x 1080 pixels.
