# Delaunay triangulation followed by clipping

- Loads the dataset can_points.ex2, generates a 3D tetrahedralization, then applies a plane clip at the origin with normal along +X (cutting to one side of x=0).
- Sets up a render view with a specified camera, displays the clipped tetrahedral mesh in wireframe, and saves a 1920Ã—1080 screenshot to points-surf-clip-screenshot.png.
