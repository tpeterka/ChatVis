I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Read in the file named 'ml-100.vtk'.
Generate an isosurface of the variable var0 at value 0.5.
Save a screenshot of the result in the filename 'ml-iso-screenshot.png'.
The rendered view and saved screenshot should be 1920 x 1080 pixels.
