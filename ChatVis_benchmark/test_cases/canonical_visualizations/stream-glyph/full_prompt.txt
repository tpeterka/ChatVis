I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Read in the file named 'disk.ex2'.
Trace streamlines of the V data array seeded from a default point cloud.
Render the streamlines with tubes.
Add cone glyphs to the streamlines.
Color the streamlines and glyphs by the Temp data array.
View the result in the +X direction.
Save a screenshot of the result in the filename 'stream-glyph-screenshot.png'.
The rendered view and saved screenshot should be 1920 x 1080 pixels.
