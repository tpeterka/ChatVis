# Canonical visualizations

These tasks consist of relatively well-known visualization operations like volume rendering, isocontouring, clipping, and line plots.
Each of these tasks require only a small number of operations. In addition, they do not include more technical requests like reading and writing in different file formats, or changing image resolution.


Each directory has a README with more details.
