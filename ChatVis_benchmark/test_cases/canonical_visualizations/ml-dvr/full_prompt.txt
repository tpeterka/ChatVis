I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Read in the file named 'ml-100.vtk'.
Generate a volume rendering using the default transfer function.
Rotate the view to an isometric direction.
Save a screenshot of the result in the filename 'ml-dvr-screenshot.png'.
The rendered view and saved screenshot should be 1920 x 1080 pixels.
