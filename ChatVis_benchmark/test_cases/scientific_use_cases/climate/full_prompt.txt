I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset of ocean currents.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Read in the file named 'mpas.vtp'.
Apply a calculator filter to compute the following function:
(-velocity_X*sin(coordsX*0.0174533) + velocity_Y*cos(coordsX*0.0174533)) * iHat + (-velocity_X * sin(coordsY*0.0174533) * cos(coordsX*0.0174533) - velocity_Y * sin(coordsY*0.0174533) * sin(coordsX*0.0174533) + velocity_Z * cos(coordsY*0.0174533)) * jHat + 0*kHat
Render the computed values using a tube filter with 0.05 as the tube radius.
Color the tubes by the magnitude of the velocity.
Light the tubes with the maximum shininess and include normals in the lighting.
Add cone glyphs to show the direction of the velocity.
The glyphs are composed of 10 polygons, having a radius 0 0.15, a height of 0.5, and a scaling factor of 0.5.
View the result in the -z direction.
Adjust the view so that the tubes occupy the 90% of the image.
Save a screenshot of the result in the filename 'soma-screenshot.png'.
The rendered view and saved screenshot should be 2294 x 1440 pixels with a white background.
