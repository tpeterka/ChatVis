# Scientific use cases

The tasks in the benchmark are drawn from real visualization workflows used by scientists.
One use case from the field of climate science visualizes a dataset describing ocean currents.
Another use case, from materials science, visualizes a nanocrystal reconstructed from a diffraction pattern captured by a high-energy x-ray synchrotron light source.

Each directory has a README with more details.
