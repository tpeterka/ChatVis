Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Read the file 'can.ex2'.
Color the dataset by the vtkBlockColors field.
Retrieve the color map, opacity transfer function, and 2D transfer function for vtkBlockColors.
Set block coloring for the block at /IOSS/element_blocks/block_2 using the x component of the ACCL variable.
Rescale the block's color and opacity maps to match the current data range of block_2.
For the ACCL variable of block_2, retrieve the color transfer function, enable the color bar, and apply cool to warm
coloring.
View the entire dataset in the -y direction, and save a screenshot with blue-gray background in 'color-blocks-screenshot.png'.
