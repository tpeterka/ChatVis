I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Set the background to a blue-gray palette.
Read the file 'can.ex2'.
This is a multiblock dataset.
Color the dataset by the vtkBlockColors field.
Retrieve the color map for vtkBlockColors.
Retrieve the opacity transfer function for vtkBlockColors.
Retrieve the 2D transfer function for vtkBlockColors.
Set block coloring for the block at /IOSS/element_blocks/block_2 using the variable ACCL on the x component of the points.
Rescale the block's color and opacity maps to match the current data range of block_2.
Retrieve the color transfer function for the ACCL variable of block_2.
Enable the color bar for block_2.
Apply a cool to warm color preset to the color map for block_2.
Set the camera to look down the -y direction and to see the entire dataset.
Save a screenshot of the visualization in the file 'color-blocks-screenshot.png'.
