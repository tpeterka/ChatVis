Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a wavelet object.
Render the RTDATA data in the wavelet and show the color bar.
[optional: Make sure the colors are rescaled to the data range]
[optional: Use the color map called 'Cool to Warm']

Next, split the view to the right and create a histogram from RTDATA.
Use the same color map as before.
Save a screenshot of the line chart in the file 'render-histogram-screenshot.png'.

[note: do we want to output a screenshot of the surface rendering too? This script creates two visualizations]
