# Histogram plotting

- Generates a synthetic wavelet dataset, shows it as a surface in a render view colored by the scalar RTData with a visible scalar bar.
- Splits the layout and adds an XY histogram chart view, plotting a histogram of RTData using the same color transfer function as the 3D view.
- Renders and saves a screenshot of the histogram view to `render-histogram-screenshot.png`.
