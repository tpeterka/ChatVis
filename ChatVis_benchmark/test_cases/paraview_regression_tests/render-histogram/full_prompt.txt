I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a wavelet object.
Render the wavelet object with a surface representation, colored by the dataset RTDATA.
Please show the color bar on the wavelet rendering.
[optional: Make sure the colors are rescaled to the data range]
[optional: Use the color map called 'Cool to Warm']

Next, split the view horizontally with a new view on the right.
Create a histogram from the wavelet object with the dataset RTDATA.
Color the histogram with the same color transfer function as the wavelet rendering.
Render the histogram.
Save a screenshot of the line chart in the file 'render-histogram-screenshot.png'.

[note: do we want to output a screenshot of the surface rendering too? This script creates two visualizations]
