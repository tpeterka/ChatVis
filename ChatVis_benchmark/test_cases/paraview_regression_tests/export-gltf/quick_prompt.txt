Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a wavelet object.
Create a surface rendering of the wavelet object and color by RTData.
Scale the color map to the data, and don't display the color bar or the orientation axes.
Export the view to 'ExportedGLTF.gltf'

Next load the file 'ExportedGLTF.gltf' and display it as a surface.
Color this object by TEXCOORD_0.
Scale the color map to the data, and don't display the color bar or the orientation axes.
Use the 'Cool to Warm' colormap.
