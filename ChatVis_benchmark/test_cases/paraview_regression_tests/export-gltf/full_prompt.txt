I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a wavelet object.
Render the wavelet object with a 'Surface' representation and color by the 'RTData' variable.
Ensure that the color map is scaled to the data set. 
Do not display the color bar or orientation axes in the rendering.
Export the view in GLTF format to the file 'ExportedGLTF.gltf'

Next load the file 'ExportedGLTF.gltf' and show it with a surface representation.
Color this object by the 'TEXCOORD_0' variable.
Ensure that the color map is scaled to the data set.
Use the 'Cool to Warm' colormap preset. 
Do not display the color bar or orientation axes in the rendering.

Save a screenshot of this view in the file 'export-gltf-screenshot.png'
