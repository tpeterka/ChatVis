Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Read the file can.ex2.  Load two element blocks: the first is called ‘Unnamed block ID: 1 Type: HEX’, the second is called ‘Unnamed block ID: 2 Type: HEX’.
Next, slice this object with a plane with origin at [0.21706008911132812, 4.0, -5.110947132110596] and normal direction [1.0, 0.0, 0.0].  The plane should have no offset.
Next, save this time series to a collection of .vtm files.  The base file name for the time series is ‘canslices.vtm’ and the suffix is ‘_%d’.  Only save time steps with index between 10 and 20 inclusive, counting by 3.
Next, load the files ‘canslices_10.vtm’, ‘canslices_13.vtm’, ‘canslices_16.vtm’, and ‘canslices_19.vtm’ in multi-block format.
Finally, show the multi-block data set you just loaded.
Save a screenshot to the file "subseries-of-time-series-screenshot.png".
