Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a wavelet object and render it as a surface.  Color the rendering by the variable ‘RTData’ but hide the color bar.
Change the layout size to 300x300 pixels.
Next, move the camera with the following settings.  The camera position should be [30.273897726939246, 40.8733980301544, 43.48927935675712].  The camera view up should be [-0.3634544237682163, 0.7916848767068606, -0.49105594165731975]. The camera parallel scale should be 17.320508075688775.
Finally, save a screenshot to the file “save-transparent-screenshot.png” with resolution 300x300 and a transparent background.
