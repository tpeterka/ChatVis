# ParaView regression tests

These tasks are adapted from ParaView’s own regression testing framework and exercise several of ParaView’s visualization routines.
They may also combine several different operations in a row.
They include more instructions that relate to a dataset’s representation, like reading/writing data in different file formats, or interfacing with the concept of VTK blocks.

Each directory has a README with more details.
