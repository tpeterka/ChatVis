# ParaView regression tests

The tasks in the benchmark are adapted from ParaView’s own regression testing framework.
These tasks exercise several of ParaView’s visualization routines.
They may also combine several different operations in a row.
They include more instructions that relate to a dataset’s representation, like reading/writing data in different file formats, or interfacing with the concept of VTK blocks.

Each directory has a README with more details.
