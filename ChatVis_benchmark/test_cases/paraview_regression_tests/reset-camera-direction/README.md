# Camera manipulation

- Sets a blue-gray background, creates a synthetic wavelet dataset, and displays it in a render view with surfaces and edges.
- Orients the camera to view the dataset from the specified direction vector (0.5, 1, 0.5) relative to the focal point, then saves a screenshot to `reset-camera-direction-screenshot.png`.
