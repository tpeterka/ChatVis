I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a Wavelet object, and set its representation to "Surface with Edges."
Set the camera direction to [0.5, 1, 0.5].
Save a screenshot to the file "reset-camera-direction-screenshot.png".
