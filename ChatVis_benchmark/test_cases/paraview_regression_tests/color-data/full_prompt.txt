I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a wavelet object.
Create a new calculator with the function 'RTData*iHat + ln(RTData)*jHat + coordsZ*kHat'.
Create a rendering view of size 1158 x 833.
Get color transfer function/color map for 'Result'.
Get opacity transfer function/opacity map for 'Result'.
Rescale color and/or opacity maps used to include current data range.
Change representation type to be a surface.
Color the representation by the x coordinate of the result.
Show the color bar/color legend.
Use a cool to warm color map.
Save a screenshot of the rendering in the file 'color-data-screenshot.png'.
