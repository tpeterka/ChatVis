# Multiple isosurfacing and PLY file writing

- Generates a synthetic wavelet volume, displays it, and extracts four isosurfaces of RTData.
- Colors the contours by RTData using its color transfer function, then exports the contour geometry to a PLY file with coloring enabled (PLYWriterData.ply) and saves a screenshot (write-ply-screenshot.png).
