Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a wavelet object, the view size should be 400x400.
Show the wavelet and zoom the camera to fit the data.
Now create a contour from the wavelet using dataset "RTData".
The contour isosurfaces should be: 97.222075, 157.09105, 216.96002500000003, and 276.829.
Show the contour with the same colormap as "RTData".
Finally, save the contour to the file "PLYWriterData.ply".
Save a screenshot to the file "write-ply-screenshot.png".
