I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Create a wavelet object.
Create a plot over line chart from the wavelet.
Plot three paths, one each for arc_length, Points_Z, and RTData variables in the line chart.
Set the opacity for arc_length to be 1 and the opacity for Points_Z and RTData to be 0.3.
Save a screenshot of the line chart in the file 'chart-opacity-screenshot.png'.
