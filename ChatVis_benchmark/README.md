# ChatVis_benchmark

ChatVis_benchmark is a suite of canonical visualization tasks, ParaView regression tests, and scientific use cases that includes comprehensive evaluation metrics. The benchmark can be used independently to evaluate other agents and LLMs.

ChatVis_benchmark includes `evaluation` and `test_cases`. The `evaluation` directory can evaluate test images against ground truth images using several image metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. The `test_cases` directory includes test cases drawn from canonical visualization tasks, Paraview regression tests, and full scientific use cases.

Each directory has a README with more details.
